# 🛡️ Next.js Auth Grind

Yo! This is my personal lab where I’m leveling up my **authentication game** using:

- 🧠 Next.js (App Router)
- 🎨 TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- 🔐 BetterAuth for clean auth flows
- ⚙️ TypeScript (strict mode, ofc)
- ⚡ pnpm (because npm is slow)

---

## 🚀 What I’m Building

This ain’t no Hello World app. I'm working on **real-world auth features** like:

- ✅ Login / Logout flow
- ✅ Google OAuth
- ✅ Get current user info
- ✅ Protected API routes
- ✅ Middleware-based route guarding
- ✅ Auth UI with shadcn/ui

> Basically, all the auth magic modern apps need. I’m tryna master it.
